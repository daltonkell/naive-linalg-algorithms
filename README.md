### Naive Implementations of Linear Algebra Algorithms

This repository is a set of programs written to illustrate naive implementations of
well-known linear algebra procedures. At the time of writing this, only very basic
algorithms are intended to be covered, and a very limited number at that. This is
not a software development project, but an academic exercise.

These algorithms and thoughts are mostly not my own. I'm getting most of the ideas and
implementation structure from

    1. Makefile
    2. Compiler information
